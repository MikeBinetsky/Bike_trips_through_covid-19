Observations!

### NUMBER OF RIDES ###
Firstly, In terms of the number of bike rides, it appears that in the first month of the Covid-19 pandemic that bike share rides dropped dramatically, by about 1/3. However, within the next 2 months this number went back to the pre-covid numbers and even surpassed it. This tells me that during the first 1-2 months of covid, people took it mostly seriously and stayed indoors with quickly opting to go back outside after about 2 months.

### PEAK HOURS ###
The peak hours to start riding is 5pm and the peak endtime is 6pm with the lowest hours consistently being 3am and 4am. This seems pretty realistic in general as people tend to get off work around that time and are more free to bike for free time or to travel home from work. It scales up to that time and down after that time as well which shows a unique cycle of peaking at 5pm, decreasing until 3 or 4, and then increasing again as time goes on.

### TOP AND BOTTOM STATIONS ###

The top 10 stations and the bottom 10 stations have one thing in common, they had a lot of use in August, at least for the starting stations. Most (8/10) of the bottom ten starting stations were rented completely in August and the top 10 had a lot of use in august as well. You can see the use increase as months go on. One thing about the bottom ten stations not also being the most used in august and having vastly lower numbers than the bottom 10 starting stations tells me that the bottom ten starting stations are much less desiriable locations than the starting locations. It's possible people emigrate away from those locations for any number of reasons.

### GENDER BIKE USAGE ###

In general, males use the bikes much more often than females, though don't be discouraged. In terms of identified male or female gender for rides, women have about half the amount males do. Over time this may increase with more registered users.

### TOTAL TRIPS AND SUBSCRIBERS ###

Good news though! It looks like of the number of users, the majority of them are subscribers already. With a ratio of about 70% subscribed users to about 30% unsubscribed customers, that seems like a great ratio of usage. The staying power of your subscribers can be seen here as well as the number of subscribed users in March, April, and June dwarfs that of of the unsubscribed customers. You can see that they'll still use it much more frequently than non-subscribed users even in a global pandemic. Go you!

### AVERAGE TRIP DURATION BY AGE ###

This one is going to hurt you a bit and I'm sorry. Firstly some good news, you have a wide variety of ages of subscribers that use your service! That's great diversity and you should feel great about that. On the bad news side, it seems that quite a few of them likely lie about their age. There's a number of incredibly highly aged users over the age of 110 that take long trips using your service. Realistically, it is doubtful that 111 year olds are taking an average of near 2 hour long bike rides. And that's not all, there's data for 127 year olds, 134 year olds, and 145 year olds. Now it's possible that this is just old data as the registered users entered their birthdays when the system was still young and it's been around for a while, but we know that isn't true. The first time citibike opened was in 2013. The oldest living person was 122 when they died in 1997, so if these 145 year olds were riding your bikes in 2013 they would have been 137, over a decade older than the oldest person to ever live. Sorry, you got age duped.
